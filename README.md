## Summary of Project

## Structure
- `src` 
    - `java`
        - `cfg`: This module contains control-flow-graph creation for PL/SQL stored procedure
        - `taintchecker`: This module coontains the core logic for taint analysis on the Intermediate Representation created    
    - `resource`: contains the various types of input example that has been given to the source code.
- `visualization`: This folder contains the control flow graph in .dot file format for visualization on Gephi tool.


## Execution Instructions to reproduce the result

### 1. Pre-requisite setup to run the code

### 2. Run the tainanalyzer for various input code

### 3. Visualization setup to view the control flow graph
